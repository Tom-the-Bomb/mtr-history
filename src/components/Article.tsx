                            In a world with ever-evolving transportation technology, metro systems remain one of the most prevalent modes of transportation globally.
                            For various cities, a good metro system represents their bloodline, providing the population with a more convenient,
                            affordable, and environmentally friendly alternative for their daily commute. Yet, designing and constructing a successful,
                            robust system can be quite a daunting task, especially for developing nations. Even today, we still observe a significant
                            discrepancy in the quality of systems across various cities worldwide, with some systems being objectively inferior to others,
                            even in comparably sized cities. Among these many metropolises, Hong Kong stands out as one that boasts one of the best transit
                            networks in the world. With a robust public transit system featuring 10 heavy rail lines with 98 stations, a 68-station light rail
                            network, and a vast network of buses and trams throughout the city. In 2024, there were around 12 million passenger journeys daily taken on public transit
                            (6 million on the <Link href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Transit_Railway">Mass Transit Railway (MTR)</Link> alone),
                            in a city of just over 7 million people.

                        <div>
                            For most cities, public transit is viewed as social welfare, and is only used by the young and lower class.
                            Driving remains the primary method of transportation; therefore, transit fares are kept low as an alternative
                            for those who cannot afford to drive. As a result, most systems operate at a deficit and require substantial
                            government subsidies. Thus, many systems' infrastructure is built and maintained at a bare minimum, resulting
                            in low frequencies, poor on-time rates, and minimal coverage. The MTR operates under a unique business model,
                            placing it as one of the only metro systems in the world that operate at a profit. By involving itself in
                            the real estate sector, the MTR's Rail + Property model allows it to profit from the increase in land value
                            following transit development. As a result, numerous properties in Hong Kong are built and owned by the MTR,
                            including several shopping malls, office buildings, and entire new towns. By being self-sustaining and not
                            reliant on government subsidies, the MTR can operate a highly efficient, modern metro system
                            (with a 99.9% on-time rate) that is preferred by residents over any other mode of transportation.

                                When the MTR wants to build a new line, the government first provides it with land development rights at stations or
                                depots along the route. The MTR pays the government the land's market value (pre-railway construction) and then constructs
                                the railway line. The MTR then partners with private developers to build properties on the land it has acquired,
                                and they end up receiving a share of the profits that the developers make from these properties. Through this, the MTR
                                generates funds for future railway projects and regular maintenance of the existing network. As an example, the MTR made
                                a profit of $16bn HKD in 2014, despite their fares still being maintained at a low average of ~$7 HKD per trip, as nearly
                                half of it came from its properties.

                                In the 1960s, Hong Kong was a British colony experiencing rapid population growth and urbanization.
                                The colonial government recognized the need for an underground transportation system to alleviate traffic
                                congestion and support economic development. In 1975, the MTR Corporation was established as a
                                government-owned entity to oversee the construction and operation of the metro system. During its
                                establishment, the government required that the MTR adhere to “prudent commercial principles”,
                                the main reason behind the system's success today. These principles required the MTR to secure
                                a satisfactory rate of return on its projects, and its day-to-day operating costs must be fully
                                covered by revenues. The motive behind this was to ensure the MTR would be self-sustaining and not
                                reliant on government subsidies, which the government at the time believed to be important to avoid
                                dealing with the volatility of politics, something they had experience with back in the UK with the
                                London Underground. These policies forced the MTR to involve itself in other business activities,
                                and hence the Rail + Property model was born.

                                <h4 className="text-xl font-bold">The Uniqueness of Hong Kong</h4>
                                We can see that, unlike most metro systems, which come after the development of a city,
                                the MTR was built alongside the development of Hong Kong, with numerous properties and towns
                                having been constructed solely due to the MTR. Hong Kong is a small city with a high population density,
                                making land and new properties extremely in demand. Currently, only 25% of Hong Kong's land area is
                                developed, with the rest remaining as country parks and natural reserves. This scarcity has made the
                                MTR's development of satellite towns such as
                                &nbsp;<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOHAS_Park">LOHAS Park</Link> and
                                &nbsp;<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung">Tung Chung</Link> even more critical to Hong Kong's
                                growth. The lands these towns are built on were previously empty inacessible, giving the MTR a perfect
                                opportunity to connect it via rail, driving up land value, and building properties to accommodate the
                                growing population, and of course, turn a profit for the corporation.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The MTR is the past, present, and future of Hong Kong, having followed the development of the city
                                from its early days, back when it was not an economic powerhouse like it is today. Most of the population
                                is reliant on public transit more than anything else to get around the city. In fact, over 90% of daily
                                journeys in Hong Kong are made using public transport, one of the highest rates in the world.
                                While the US has 800 cars for every 1000 people, Hong Kong only has 92. Car ownership in Hong Kong
                                is very expensive, and after factoring in parking and congestion, it is simply not worth it for the majority
                                of the population. With such a high reliance on public transit, the MTR has the ability to influence where
                                these 90% of people go everyday, and thus, making property around stations extremely valuable to businesses
                                and developers.

                                            Cross-platform interchanges are a feature that allows passengers to transfer between two lines
                                            by simply walking across the platform, without needing to go up or down stairs. This feature
                                            is extremely convenient, as it reduces transfer times and congestion in the station, especially
                                            during peak hours. Not only does the MTR have the highest number of cross-platform interchanges
                                            of any system in the world, but it has taken it a step further by implementing bi-directional
                                            cross-platform interchanges at 2 consecutive stations. What this means is that when interchanging
                                            between 2 lines, instead of only being able to interchange at only 1 station, passengers can
                                            interchange at either of 2 consecutive stations, depending on which direction they wish to go.

                                        &nbsp;<b>same-direction</b> cross-platform interchanges. This 2 station interchange system allows for both
                                        same-direction and opposite-direction cross-platform interchanges, such that passengers are able take
                                        advantage of cross-platform interchanges regardless of their direction/route. Combined with the high frequency
                                        of trains on both lines, this seamless setup makes it feel like the two lines are effectively one.
                                        Although this may seem simple, it actually requires meticulous planning and engineering, as somewhere between
                                        the 2 stations, the tracks of at least 1 line must swap in order to achieve this effect.

                                Introduced in 1997 by the MTR, the
                                &nbsp;<Link href="https://www.octopus.com.hk/en/consumer/octopus-cards/about/index.html">Octopus Card (八達通)</Link> was one of the world's first contactless smart card
                                systems for public transportation. The card can be used to pay for fares on the MTR, buses, trams, ferries,
                                and much more. Unlike other transit cards, which are only used for transportation, the Octopus Card has
                                become one of the most popular payment methods in Hong Kong in general, from food to shopping, to even
                                taking attendance at schools. It is so popular that recently, stores in Japan have begun accepting Octopus
                                Cards as a payment method due to the large number of Hong Kong tourists.

                            The MTR's projects are not limited to Hong Kong. Due to its success, the MTR has been commissioned
                            to work on and operate several metro systems
                            &nbsp;<Link href="https://www.mtr.com.hk/en/corporate/consultancy/railwayoperation.html">overseas</Link>,
                            including several in mainland China, such as Beijing Metro Line 4, Shenzhen Metro Line 4, Hangzhou Metro Line 1 & 5. The MTR has also aided in the
                            development and operation of other systems through partially owned subsidiaries such as Metro Trains
                            Melbourne (Melbourne Metropolitan Rail), Metro Trains Sydney (Sydney Metro), and MTR Tunnelbanan AB
                            (Stockholm Metro).
                            <br/><br/>
                            A primary incentive for the MTR to participate in these projects is to limit brain drain from its own workforce.
                            Hong Kong does not have the capacity to continuously pump out new railway projects, and thus, many employees
                            would be left without work, leading them to seek employment elsewhere. These workers, with the valuable
                            experience from past MTR projects, are critical for the MTR to retain for the success of future projects,
                            and thus the MTR does so through these projects outside of Hong Kong.

                            The MTR system of Hong Kong has always been a popular choice as a case study for urban planners and transit
                            enthusiasts alike. It is a prime example of how a metro system can be successful and profitable through
                            innovative business models and policies. The MTR has grown with the city and citizens of Hong Kong, and
                            earned its spot as the backbone of the city's transportation network.
